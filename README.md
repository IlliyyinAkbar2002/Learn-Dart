## Basic Dart

Dart is a client-optimized programming language for fast apps on any platform. It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based language with C-style syntax.

### Key Features of Dart:
- **Strongly Typed**: Dart is a statically typed language, which means that type checking is done at compile time.
- **Null Safety**: Dart provides sound null safety, which helps in avoiding null reference errors.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Dart supports asynchronous programming with features like `async` and `await`.
- **Rich Standard Library**: Dart comes with a comprehensive standard library that includes collections, math, and more.

### Getting Started with Dart:
1. **Installation**: You can install Dart from the official [Dart website](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
2. **Hello World**: A simple Dart program looks like this:
   ```dart
   void main() {
     print('Hello, World!');
   }
   ```
3. **Running Dart Code**: Use the Dart SDK to run your Dart programs with the command `dart run <filename>.dart`.

For more detailed information, refer to the [Dart documentation](https://dart.dev/guides).

## Change Description

**Update:** Added a new section on **Functions and Lambdas** to enhance the course material. This section covers:

- **Defining Functions**: Learn how to create and use named functions in Dart.
- **Anonymous Functions (Lambdas)**: Understand how to use anonymous functions for callbacks and short operations.
- **Arrow Functions**: Explore the shorthand syntax for writing concise functions.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Discover how to use functions that take other functions as parameters or return functions.
- **Closures**: Gain insight into how functions can capture and use variables from their surrounding scope.

These additions aim to provide a deeper understanding of functional programming in Dart, enabling you to write more efficient and expressive code.
