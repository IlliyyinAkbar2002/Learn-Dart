## Basic Dart

Dart is a client-optimized programming language for fast apps on any platform. It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based language with C-style syntax.

### Key Features of Dart:
- **Strongly Typed**: Dart is a statically typed language, which means that type checking is done at compile time.
- **Null Safety**: Dart provides sound null safety, which helps in avoiding null reference errors.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Dart supports asynchronous programming with features like `async` and `await`.
- **Rich Standard Library**: Dart comes with a comprehensive standard library that includes collections, math, and more.

### Getting Started with Dart:
1. **Installation**: You can install Dart from the official [Dart website](https://dart.dev/get-dart).
2. **Hello World**: A simple Dart program looks like this:
   ```dart
   void main() {
     print('Hello, World!');
   }
   ```
3. **Running Dart Code**: Use the Dart SDK to run your Dart programs with the command `dart run <filename>.dart`.
